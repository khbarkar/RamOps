# Security and Legal Disclaimer

## Educational Purpose Only

Ram Ops is designed **exclusively for educational and training purposes** in controlled environments. The scenarios simulate security incidents, system compromises, and infrastructure failures to help teams practice incident response and troubleshooting skills.

## Important Warnings

### ⚠️ DO NOT Use in Production

- **NEVER** run these scenarios on production systems
- **NEVER** run these scenarios on systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test
- **NEVER** use these techniques outside of isolated training environments

### ⚠️ Simulated Malware and Exploits

This project contains:
- Simulated rootkits and malware
- Backdoor accounts and unauthorized access mechanisms
- Cryptomining simulations
- Log tampering techniques
- Reverse shells and command & control simulations
- Compromised system binaries

**These are for training purposes only.** Using these techniques against systems without authorization is illegal.

## Legal Disclaimer

### No Warranty

This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors and contributors:
- Make no guarantees about the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the scenarios
- Are not responsible for any damage, data loss, or security incidents resulting from use of this software
- Do not guarantee that scenarios will work on all systems or configurations

### User Responsibility

By using Ram Ops, you agree that:
- You will only use it in isolated, non-production environments
- You have proper authorization for any systems you test on
- You understand the security implications of the simulated attacks
- You are responsible for any consequences of misuse
- You will not use these techniques for malicious purposes

### Compliance with Laws

Users must:
- Comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws
- Obtain proper authorization before testing on any systems
- Not use this software for unauthorized access, data theft, or malicious activities
- Understand that unauthorized computer access is a crime in most jurisdictions

## Ethical Use

This project is intended to:
- Improve incident response skills
- Teach security and forensics concepts
- Help teams prepare for real security incidents
- Promote better security practices

It is **NOT** intended to:
- Enable malicious hacking or unauthorized access
- Bypass security controls on systems you don't own
- Cause harm to any systems or organizations
- Violate any laws or regulations

## Isolation Requirements

When running Ram Ops scenarios:
- Use isolated virtual machines (Lima, Kind, etc.)
- Do not connect training environments to production networks
- Clean up all scenarios after completion
- Do not leave backdoors or compromised systems running
- Understand what each scenario does before running it

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover actual security vulnerabilities in the Ram Ops codebase itself (not the intentional simulated vulnerabilities), please report them responsibly to the project maintainers.

## Acknowledgment

By downloading, installing, or using Ram Ops, you acknowledge that:
- You have read and understood this disclaimer
- You agree to use the software only for legitimate educational purposes
- You accept full responsibility for your use of the software
